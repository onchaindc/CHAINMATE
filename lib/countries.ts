/**
 * Optional country selection for player profiles. Country is never required;
 * when a player sets one, a small marker renders next to their username.
 *
 * Rendering lives in components/ui/country-flag.tsx, NOT here: the flags are
 * SVG files served from /public/flags (one per code below), because emoji flags
 * only draw as flags on platforms that ship flag glyphs — Windows does not.
 * Adding a country here means adding public/flags/<CODE>.svg alongside it.
